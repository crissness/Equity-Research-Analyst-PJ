# Dividend Discount Models (DDM) Suite

A comprehensive Python implementation of three essential dividend discount models for equity valuation in corporate finance. This suite provides professional-grade tools for valuing stocks based on expected dividend payments and growth patterns.

## üìã Overview

This collection includes three sophisticated dividend discount models:

1. **Gordon Growth Model (DDM_ST.py)** - Single-stage stable growth valuation
2. **Two-Stage DDM (DDM_2ST.py)** - High growth followed by stable growth
3. **Three-Stage DDM (DDM_3ST.py)** - High growth, transition, and stable growth phases

Each model features interactive input collection, comprehensive validation, sensitivity analysis, and professional visualizations.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Interactive User Interface**: Guided input collection with validation and defaults
- **Multiple Growth Rate Estimation Methods**: Historical, analyst forecasts, and fundamental analysis
- **Flexible Cost of Equity Calculation**: Direct input or CAPM-based calculation
- **Comprehensive Sensitivity Analysis**: Test various scenarios and assumptions
- **Professional Visualizations**: Enhanced charts and graphs for analysis
- **Results Export**: Save calculations and analysis to text files
- **Warning System**: Automatic detection of potentially problematic inputs

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Weighted Growth Rate Averaging**: Combine multiple growth estimation methods
- **Dynamic Parameter Adjustment**: Beta and payout ratio changes across phases
- **Gradient Transition Modeling**: Smooth transitions between growth phases
- **Present Value Calculations**: Detailed breakdown of value components
- **Value Decomposition**: Separate analysis of growth value vs. assets in place

## üì¶ Requirements

```python
# Required packages
matplotlib >= 3.0.0
numpy >= 1.18.0
scipy >= 1.4.0
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy scipy
```

## üîß Installation

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed
3. Install required dependencies
4. Run any of the model files directly

## üìñ Usage

### Gordon Growth Model (Single-Stage)
```bash
python DDM_ST.py
```

**Best for:**
- Mature, stable companies
- Consistent dividend payout history
- Predictable growth patterns
- Utility companies, REITs, consumer staples

**Key Inputs:**
- Current earnings per share
- Dividend payout ratio
- Cost of equity (direct or CAPM components)
- Expected perpetual growth rate

### Two-Stage DDM
```bash
python DDM_2ST.py
```

**Best for:**
- Companies transitioning from growth to maturity
- Clear inflection point in growth trajectory
- Mid-cap companies with defined growth phases

**Key Inputs:**
- High growth period length and rate
- Stable growth assumptions
- Changing payout ratios between phases
- Different beta for stable period (optional)

### Three-Stage DDM
```bash
python DDM_3ST.py
```

**Best for:**
- Young, high-growth companies
- Complex growth trajectories
- Technology and biotech companies
- Detailed long-term forecasting

**Key Inputs:**
- Three distinct growth phases
- Gradual transition parameters
- Dynamic cost of equity adjustments
- Evolving dividend policies

## üí° Model Methodology

### Growth Rate Estimation
Each model supports multiple growth rate estimation methods:

1. **Historical Growth**: Based on EPS growth over past 5 years
2. **Analyst Estimates**: External growth predictions
3. **Fundamental Analysis**: ROE √ó Retention rate approach

Users assign weights to each method for a composite growth estimate.

### Cost of Equity Calculation
Two approaches available:

1. **Direct Input**: User provides cost of equity directly
2. **CAPM Method**: Risk-free rate + (Beta √ó Market risk premium)

### Valuation Formula

**Gordon Growth Model:**
```
Value = D‚ÇÅ / (r - g)
```

**Two-Stage Model:**
```
Value = Œ£(Dt/(1+r)^t) + [Dn+1/(r-g)]/(1+r)^n
```

**Three-Stage Model:**
```
Value = Œ£(High Growth PV) + Œ£(Transition PV) + Terminal Value PV
```

Where:
- D = Dividends
- r = Cost of equity
- g = Growth rate
- t = Time period

## üìä Output Features

- Year-by-year dividend projections
- Present value calculations
- Value decomposition analysis

### Sensitivity Analysis

- Growth period sensitivity
- Cost of equity sensitivity
- Interactive parameter testing

### Professional Visualizations

- Unrealistic growth assumptions
- High beta values for stable firms
- Low payout ratios
- Negative inputs
- Mathematical inconsistencies

## üéØ Example Use Cases

### Technology Startup Valuation
Use Three-Stage DDM for a company expected to have:
- 10 years of high growth (25% annually)
- 5 years of declining growth (25% ‚Üí 8%)
- Stable growth thereafter (8% annually)

### Utility Company Valuation
Use Gordon Growth Model for:
- Stable dividend-paying utility
- Consistent 4-6% growth
- Regulated business environment

### Mid-Cap Growth Company
Use Two-Stage DDM for:
- Current high growth phase (15% for 7 years)
- Transition to mature growth (8% thereafter)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### Model Limitations
- **Dividend Dependency**: Only suitable for dividend-paying companies
- **Growth Assumptions**: Sensitive to growth rate estimates
- **Terminal Value**: Large portion of value often in terminal period
- **Market Conditions**: Doesn't account for market sentiment or timing

### Best Practices
1. **Use Multiple Scenarios**: Run sensitivity analysis extensively
2. **Validate Assumptions**: Compare with historical performance
3. **Consider Industry Factors**: Adjust for sector-specific characteristics
4. **Regular Updates**: Refresh assumptions as new information becomes available
